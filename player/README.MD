# Kumite player

This module is a **sample** project of a robot playing contests. It demonstrate how to interact with a `contest-server`.

It is configured through:

- `kumite.player.contest-base-url`: Typically `localhost:8080` or `https://kumite-dev-d2844865d26b.herokuapp.com/`
- `kumite.player.refresh_token`: Fetched with a browser at `<kumite.player.contest-base-url>/html/me`
